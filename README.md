Loan Repayment Prediction Using Ensemble Learning Methods

Overview:
This project predicts loan repayment behavior using machine learning techniques. Various ensemble learning methods enhance prediction accuracy and assist financial institutions in risk assessment.

Features:

Analysis of historical loan data.

Utilization of multiple machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).

Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Feature importance analysis to identify key influencing factors.

Dataset:

Sourced from Kaggle.

Contains borrower demographics, loan attributes, repayment history, and economic indicators.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into meaningful features.

Model Selection: Training and evaluating classification models:

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance using Grid Search and Cross-validation.

Model Evaluation: Comparing models based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Interpretability Analysis: Using SHAP and feature importance methods.

Deployment: Implementing the model in a production environment for real-time prediction.

Results:

Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 88%.

Decision Tree and Stochastic Gradient Descent performed well (83-85% accuracy).

Feature importance analysis identified borrower credit history and loan terms as key factors.
